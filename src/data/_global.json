For cats, the essential core vaccines are rabies vaccine again for legal protection; FVRCP vaccine, which protects against three nasty colds - feline viral rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, and panleukopenia virus; and feline leukemia vaccine for prevention of this sometimes fatal viral infection that is spread through saliva and blood."

          "answer": "Most core vaccines and boosters stimulate at least 3 years, if not longer, of immunity; however, they still require regular booster shots over a pet's lifetime. Generally, after the first round of vaccines during puppy or kittenhood, boosters are given at one year old and then every 1-3 years, depending on the specific vaccine type and your pet's individual needs. Your vet will figure out the best booster schedule for each vaccine to make sure your pet's immunity stays strong."

However, more severe allergic reactions are very rare. Overall, the huge disease protection benefits from vaccination far outweigh the tiny risks for most pets."

          "answer": "For most routine imaging like standard 2D x-rays and ultrasound, pets need only gentle restraint and minimal sedation at most to stay still and comfortable. However, for advanced cross-sectional imaging like CT scans and MRIs where stillness is crucial, deeper anesthesia is needed for the duration of the scan to get the best diagnostic images without any motion blur or distortion."

          "question": "Does my pet need to be sedated?",
          "answer": "Fortunately, ultrasound is a very well-tolerated diagnostic method that rarely requires sedation or anesthesia for pets.

For anxious pets, we sometimes administer mild sedatives to ensure a smooth ultrasound experience."
