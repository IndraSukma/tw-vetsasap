        When traveling with your pet within the US, there are different pet health rules depending on where you're going. Some states require a check-up by a USDA-accredited vet, current shots, lab
        testing, and getting an approved domestic pet health travel certificate, also called a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection.

      <h2>What is a Virtual Domestic Travel Certificate?</h2>
      <p>
        A virtual domestic travel certificate is an online way to get health documentation for your pet when traveling within the U.S. or Canada. It's an easy process that saves you a lot of time and
        hassle. You don't need to visit the clinic. We just check your pet's vaccinations are up to date so you can get a compliant certificate from anywhere.
      </p>

      <h2>What to Expect with a Virtual Domestic Travel Certificate</h2>

      <p>
        After you ask for your virtual certificate and send us your pet's information through our secure online form, we'll do a quick review of their medical history and vaccination records. Once we
        make sure they meet all state and airline health requirements, we will make an official certificate and email it right away for you to print. The certificate is good for domestic air travel
        within the U.S. and Canada, as well as ground transport across state lines. We're available by phone if you have any questions!
      </p>
      <h2>How a Virtual Domestic Travel Certificate Benefits You and Your Pet</h2>
      <p>
        Avoiding an unnecessary clinic visit saves you stress and hassle when getting ready for pet travel. You'll know that your pet meets health requirements in advance, so you can focus on other
        parts of your trip. Virtual certificates also prevent cutting it too close to departure and risk compliance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Easy access lets you update certificates as needed for multi-stop trips. Most importantly, virtual certificates help get your pet to their place safely and smoothly. Get easy domestic travel
        clearance for your pet instantly online through our online documentation services at Vets ASAP.
