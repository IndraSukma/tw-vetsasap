          In-home vet care provides a convenient way for pets to receive quality veterinary services within the comfort of their own home. Mobile vets can treat many of the same common health issues
          that would typically require a trip to the clinic.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Here are some of the most frequently treated medical conditions and services provided by in-home veterinary practices:</strong>
        </p>
        <h2>Routine Preventative Care</h2>
        <img src="@img/blog/person-holding-dog.webp" alt="Person Holding Dog" />
        <h4>Vaccinations</h4>
        <p>
          Mobile vets carry all core and lifestyle vaccine antigens to customize protection based on your pet's risk profile and geographical region. Rabies, DHPP, FVRCP, FeLV, Lyme, Leptospirosis,
          and other critical shots are administered per your pet's age and vaccine schedule. In-home delivery ensures they stay current on protection against contagious illnesses.
        </p>
        <h4>Wellness Examinations</h4>
        <p>
          Your vet will perform annual or bi-annual wellness physical exams, evaluating your pet from nose to tail, including eyes, skin, coat, weight, heart, lungs, abdomen, joints, dental health,
          and neurological function. Any concerns found prompt recommendations for additional diagnostics like bloodwork, urinalysis, or fecal tests to screen for internal issues early when treatment
          is most effective.
        </p>
        <h4>Professional Dental Cleanings and Oral Health Assessments</h4>
        <p>
          Allow your vet access to perform non-anesthetic dental cleanings using specialized ultrasonic scalers to remove built-up calculus and tartar above and below the gum line. Polishing follows
          to smooth surfaces. They'll examine teeth, gums, and oral cavities for signs of infection requiring antibiotic therapy or resorption and fractures indicating extractions.
        </p>
        <h4>Parasite Prevention and Fecal Testing</h4>
        <p>
          Have fresh stool samples ready for microscopic fecal exams, checking for intestinal worms or protozoan parasites, which could lead to malnutrition, anemia, or gastroenteritis if left
          untreated. Your vet will provide oral and topical parasite preventatives like heartworm, flea, and tick medication tailored to your geographic risks.
        </p>
        <h4>Microchipping</h4>
        <p>
          Microchip implantation takes just seconds to provide permanent identification and 24/7 lifetime lost pet tracing services. Your vet keeps microchip scanners on hand to confirm existing
          registration and scan for microchips in new pets.
        </p>
        <h4>Prescription Refill Needs</h4>
        <p>
          Don't let ongoing prescription medications lapse - alert your in-home vet to any refill needs during the appointment so they can conduct an exam and renew your pet's medications just as at a
          regular veterinary clinic.
        </p>
        <h2>Common Illnesses and Infections</h2>
        <img src="@img/blog/cat-lying-on-pink-textile.webp" alt="Cat Lying on Pink Textile" />
        <p>
          In addition to preventative care, mobile veterinarians can diagnose and develop treatment plans for many common illnesses right in your home. Catching infections early improves outcomes and
          minimizes suffering and complications.
        </p>
        <h4>Dermatologic Conditions</h4>
        <p>
          In-home vets carry microscopes to perform skin scrapings, tape preps, and examinations for the presence of mites, yeast, or bacteria causing parasitism, infection, and inflammation. They can
          provide antibiotics, antifungals, medicated shampoos, allergy management, and other relief for issues like mange, ringworm, pyoderma hot spots, allergic reactions, and autoimmune skin
          disorders.
        </p>
        <h4>Ear Infections</h4>
        <p>
          Examining ears with otoscopes allows evaluation of the ear canal and eardrum for signs of infection like discharge, odor, redness, swelling, head tilting, or scratching. Oral or topical
          medications treat bacterial and fungal infections to restore ear comfort and function.
        </p>
        <h4>Ocular Diseases</h4>
        <p>
          Eye tests assess pupil response, intraocular pressure, corneal ulcers, discharge, eyelid/conjunctival abnormalities, and other signs of issues like glaucoma, dry eye, cataracts, progressive
          retinal atrophy, and infectious conditions that warrant ophthalmologic referral.
        </p>
        <h4>Urinary Tract Infections</h4>
        <p>
          Collecting and analyzing urine samples during the visit identifies bacteria causing uncomfortable UTIs so appropriate antibiotics can be prescribed along with recommendations to enhance
          urinary health long-term through dietary changes.
        </p>
        <h4>Gastrointestinal Upsets</h4>
        <p>
          Vets assess symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, weight loss, poor appetite, bloating, and nausea that could stem from parasites, food reactions, foreign body obstructions,
          toxicity, metabolic conditions, stress, infections, inflammations, and other GI disturbances - guiding proper treatment and management.
        </p>
        <h4>Allergies</h4>
        <p>
          Diagnosing allergy triggers like fleas, environment, or food allows tailored therapy with anti-itch medications, hypoallergenic dietary transitions, and avoidance guidance to relieve
          associated uncomfortable itching, skin irritation, and ear and paw infections.
        </p>
        <p>Prompt at-home diagnosis and treatment provide timely relief when pets are under the weather and prevent minor issues from becoming emergencies.</p>
        <h2>Chronic Disease Management</h2>
        <img src="@img/blog/dog-with-intravenous-line.webp" alt="Dog With Intravenous Line" />
        <h4>Diabetes</h4>
        <p>Help diabetic pets maintain stable blood sugar through insulin therapy, glucose curve testing, diet regulation, and at-home monitoring.</p>
        <h4>Kidney Disease</h4>
        <p>Detect kidney issues early through bloodwork. Guide diet and hydration along with medications to support renal function.</p>
        <h4>Heart Disease</h4>
        <p>Manage heart disease with medications and lifestyle changes. In-home ultrasound helps assess an enlarged heart or fluid in the lungs.</p>
        <h4>Arthritis</h4>

        <h4>Anxiety</h4>
        <p>Alleviate anxiety and fearfulness with pheromone therapy, medications if needed, and behavioral modification plans.</p>
        <h2>Geriatric and End-of-Life Care</h2>

        <h4>Pain Management</h4>

        <h4>In-Home Euthanasia</h4>
