        As part of your pet's Wellness Exam, your Vets ASAP veterinarian will check your pet's orthopedic and neurological health. We can check how your pet's bones and joints work in different ways.
        Pets often hide their problems very well, so it is important for you to tell us about any changes you've noticed at your place.

      <h2>What is a Vet Orthopedic Exam?</h2>
      <p>
        A vet orthopedic exam is when we check your pet's muscles, bones, joints, and other parts of their limbs and spine. It helps us find out if your pet has any problems with their movement or
        walking, that could mean they have a bone or joint disease.
      </p>

      <h2>What to Expect During a Vet Orthopedic Exam</h2>

      <p>
        You need an appointment so that one of our vets can check your pet and confirm your pet's health status. We will look at your pet's injury, trauma, or mobility history, including where/how
        long problems happen. We'll touch joints and limbs to check for pain, looseness, swelling, heat, and range of motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll watch how your pet walks to see any limping, compensation, or trouble standing. We may suggest more tests like x-rays, MRI, or CT scan to look at bone/joint structures for damage,
        breaks, dislocations, or other problems. With an accurate diagnosis, we can give you personalized treatment from joint supplements to braces, rehab to surgery
      </p>
      <h2>How a Vet Orthopedic Exam Benefits Your Pet</h2>
      <p>
        Finding out the exact bone and joint problem through a skilled exam and tests is key for the right treatment to make your pet comfortable and able to move. Early diagnosis of many orthopedic
        problems leads to better results before things get worse and can't be fixed.
      </p>

      <p>
        We help avoid getting worse to arthritis, deformity, and loss of movement through proper care. Your buddy can keep active healthy joints through every life stage. Fix movement problems for
        your furry friend. Contact Vets ASAP today to get expert vet orthopedic care.
