        Vet X-ray is used to find out what's wrong with your pet. X-rays may be recommended when your vet needs a clear picture of what's inside your pet. Our care teams can do X-rays at your home or
        in our Vets ASAP van, wherever you are.

      <h2>What is Vet Diagnostic Imaging?</h2>
      <p>
        Vet diagnostic imaging uses technologies like X-ray, ultrasound, MRI, and CT scans to noninvasively show what's inside your pet's body. These images help find problems, do treatments, and
        check health changes. Diagnostic imaging is very important for modern vet medicine.
      </p>

      <p>These imaging technologies, often used as part of wellness screening and diagnostic workups, include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Radiography (X-rays) uses short wavelength electromagnetic radiation to produce images of bone, tissue, and fluid density differences.</li>
        <li>Ultrasonography uses safe high-frequency sound waves to create images of internal organs based on sound feedback.</li>
        <li>Computed tomography (CT) uses rotating X-ray beams and computer synthesis to make 3D cross-sectional images slice-by-slice.</li>
        <li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses powerful magnets and radio frequencies to generate 3D anatomic images based on proton density and tissue conduction.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What to Expect During Vet Diagnostic Imaging</h2>
      <p>
        Our vet radiologists take diagnostic images using specialized, high-resolution equipment right in our vet hospital. For X-rays, your pet will be gently positioned, and images taken from
        different angles based on the area of concern. For ultrasounds, a transducer glides over the skin after applying the gel.
      </p>
      <p>
        For advanced CT/MRI, your pet is awake but stays still during the short scan. Most procedures are quick, with pets and owners present nearby. You can view your pet's images and discuss the
        results with the radiologist afterward.
      </p>
      <h2>How Vet Diagnostic Imaging Benefits Your Pet</h2>
      <p>
        Images provide critical information about conditions not visible externally for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Radiologists can identify signs of cancer, fractures, organ
        malformations, bladder stones, tumors, and much more. Images also guide minimally invasive procedures like biopsies.
      </p>

      <p>
        They monitor disease progression over time to adjust treatments accordingly. By finding internal issues early, imaging leads to better health outcomes for your pet. See what you can't see to
        learn more about your pet's health. Contact Vets ASAP today to learn more about our vet diagnostic imaging services.
